# Christmas stories

## Story by Jonas Peuker and Lars Wunderlich
{{1}}
Once upon a time there was a kingdom called Megburry that was ruled by its royal family. On the throne the king himself, from time to time represented by his beloved wife, the queen. Their son, a young man with big plans visited various places in the kingdom to support the folk with advice and knowledge, a good man. In the very south of the kingdom, where otherwise only the shepherds brought their cattle, to graze them. In those badlands, hidden by tall hills a lonely tower built from stone can be found. This tower was home to one of the most famous authors of the kingdom, a man of incredible wisdom, a scholar with mindbending cognitive power. The calculator should be his name for which he was prisen all around the world.
{{1}}
One day, when the price came to the area where the tower was he took the opportunity and knocked at the door. Christmas was around the corner and the the king himselve ordered a show on Christmas eve that was worth the brilliance of his majesty.
{{1}}
The moment the prince knocked on the outstanding door of the calculator that was eleborately decorated with gears, mystical roots and even some in the evening sun bright shining juwels, he heard a mechanical ticking and clicking noise, that seemed to rise slowly straight up to the top of the enormous building. A few minutes after the noise fell silent, the door was opened from inside with an energetic movement. Out of the dark room behind it a man stepped out. He was one head smaller than the price and so latter could take a look at a man around 60 years with white hair forming a ring around his semi bald scalp. He wore a leather skirt and a belt that held tools the prince had never seen before. "come in!" said the calculator, obviously remembering the young prince from the last scientific event at the palace. Together they planned a firework for Christmas and with the help of the calculator they crated a real mathematical masterpiece. In curves of sinus and cosinus, in approximations to the outlines of the city and from graphs with the highest increase to the biggest dicrease. A work of art, that nobody in the kingdom could have seen any similar to. The Christmas feast was a great success.

One day in November, Santa Claus was looking at his list of wishlists, completely exasperated. "It's getting more every year! Where are all those lists coming from?" 
"The world population just reached 8 billion. There just are more children than there used to be." one of his elves informed him.
"But there are so many presents and so many adresses! How are we supposed to figure out the logistics?"
For a long time, Santa hadn't personally visited every household, instead delegating this task to an ever-growing army of assistants, substitutes and elves. But administrating it all was getting more and more complicated every year.
"I think I might need to finally use a computer for this." he sighed. "There is no other way I can keep track of everything. I need to digitalize my records in order to organize them."
Unfortunately, Santa had no idea how to operate a computer, having never needed one in the past, and he also didn't know whether there was a software program suited for his task, so he decided to hired a computer scientist to set up the system.
{{1}}
The programmer, who also happened to have a degree in business administration, immediately realized that the only way to distribute all of the presents with the available workforce would be to increase efficiency by making sure there were no redundant travel routes.
{{1}}
Santa thought about all the times his reindeers had been completely exhausted by senselessly zig-zagging around on their way to the different households. His assistants often had the same problem. Sometimes, on his way to the next family, he would even cross paths with one of them, seeing them visit a home, that would have fit perfectly fit into his own route, and be annoyed at himself for not having spotted this in his earlier planning, thus burdening his elves with unnecessary work.
He agreed that it would be great if a computer could ensure that this sort of thing didn't happen, so he told the computer scientist to go ahead with his idea.
{{1}}
"Essentially, the algorithm needs to implement a surjective function from the set of available presents to the set of eligible children. It needs to optimize this function for minimal travel distances and travel times." the programmer told him.
Santa did not understand exactly what he meant, but thought it sounded sensible.
{{1}}
In the following weeks, the computer scientist worked very hard on his project and finished it just in time for christmas. Santa Claus printed out the lists with the presents, children, housholds, and travel routes, gave them to his employees, and everyone went on their way.
The distribution of presents worked perfectly, and even though there were more presents to distribute this year than ever before, they were finished earlier than the year before, feeling less exhausted than usual.
"This is the best decision I ever made!" declared Santa.

## Story by Benjamin Kunsch

{{1}}
Once upon a time, during a great recession, where the energy prices were high and the food storages
were empty, Santa Claus had his annual task of delivering Chrsitmas presents to all the children. A
task that he usually fulfilled with ease, as his experience with his flying electric sleigh made the
journey around the globe rather efficient. This year though, his routine came back to bite him, since
his electric sleigh would be to expensive to power. The only alternative Santa could think of, was to
re-employ his old friends, the reindeers. However, after not being needed for many years due to the
much more comfortable, self-driving electric sleigh, the reindeers got out of shape. The reindeers
agreed to help their old friend out, but stated that they wouldn’t be able to use their magic abilities
and fly the old and heavy wooden sleigh through the sky, as they were only strong enough to pull it
on the streets. This would make navigating a lot harder, since it wouldn’t be possible to navigate by
viewing the cities and towns from above. Luckily, Santa had stored maps of every city in the world,
preparing for future times, where his eyesight might decrease to a point where he wouldn’t be able
to see the small houses in the cities and towns below properly. So far so good, the backup plan was
almost fully thought out, when Santa remembered that his alternative travel method would force
him to follow the road layout. Due to his nature, Santa wanted to be as efficient as possible and
therefore wanted to ride through every street only once. The task seemed impossible, until Santa
remembered a lesson from his mentor in the general Santa-training. Deeply buried somewhere in his
memories, there was knowledge about graph theory, which introduced a mathematical model to
transcribe road maps. He knew that graphs had two basic components, the nodes and the edges.
Two nodes could be directly connected by an edge or indirectly connected by direct connections to a
third node. Santas problem had an analogon in the field of graph theory, the Königsberg bridge
problem. Instead of the streets and intersections, the bridge problem consisted of bridges and town
districts as edges and nodes. Famous mathematician Leonhard Euler proved that a path only
including each edge once was only possible under certain circumstances. After some thinking, Santa
remembered these requirements, which were about the degrees of the nodes. The sum of all of the
degrees in a graph would always be even, since every edge raises the degree of two nodes by one. If
the degree of every node was even, the graph is called Eulerian graph. Any Eulerian graph has a path
that runs through each edge exactly once. Additionally, the starting point is always the ending point,
which is why the path is also called Euler circle. As he realized this, Santa’s mood increased
drastically, because now he just had to check the intersections for how many streets it connected.
Conventiently, most of the intersections consisted of two streets crossing eachother in a right angle,
so Santa finally had a plan how to travel to all the children efficiently and bring them their presents
on time. Santa was so relieved tht he forgot about a small issue that still existed, namely
roundabouts connecting three or even more odd numbers of streets. But how Santa solved that
problem is content from another story...

## The math riddles of Christmas and the extraordinary boy who could solve them

{{1}}
Once upon a time there was an old man who loved math very much. He would study it all day
long, and every year at Christmas time, he made up some tough math riddles and gave them
to children. For example, he asked them to solve partial differential equations or to examine
sequences for convergence. He said that if the kids could solve the challenging problems,
they would get lots of presents. Obviously, nobody was able to solve these problems for many
years.
But then, one year, there was a child named Karl Friedrich who was highly intelligent and
shared a love for math with the old man. Like the old man Karl Friedrich studied math every
day with his father who was a retired math professor. With his help and huge smartness he
could understand complex math topics that others his age couldn't even imagine. From basic
logic to set theory over to multivariable calculus, Karl Friedrich could handle various complex
mathematical problems.
He faced the tasks from the old man, and after some long nights and hard work he was able
to solve them. The old man was very surprised but happy that after all these years there was
finally a kid who was able to solve his math problems. As promised, Karl Friedrich got
thousands of presents. But as humble as Karl Friedrich was, he didn't want to keep all the
presents for himself. He shared his gifts with all the other kids from his town and gave them
the best Christmas they ever had.
In the following years, Karl Friedrich decided to pass on his knowledge to younger people and
teach them the tricks he used to solve hard math problems, like calculating the
partialsumsequence from zero to one hundred in his head without using a calculator. By
teaching math to younger ones, he caused that every year somebody could actually solve the
riddles of the old man. One day when the old man passed, Karl Friedrich, who had grown old
himself, decided to take his role. Now he was the old man who made math problems for the
children till the end of his life.

## Christmas presents

{{1}}
The calendar says 17th december. I think it's time to get some christmas presents. In the
advertisement I saw the perfect one. My little sister will be happy and thankful the whole next
year for it.
I put on my scarf and my jacket. Some gloves should be good. With a look out of the window
I see boots will be needed. The way down to the street I look in my wallet. Around 50€. The
gift for my sister needs a bit but my parents don't want something expensive. It should be
enough. With the going outside I have to think about where I go now. One present I know
where I get it but the other two?
The christmas market is on. I will go through it. They have many lovely little things. By
walking I look around. It look beautiful. Everywhere are decorations. Now by getting dark it's
the best. Some of the decorations are shining but no big light like the street lanterns are on.
A layer of snow is everywhere except on the street and the footpath. Everywhere this
annoying stones. Either there is no snow and they kill my shoes faster or they are under the
snow and do nothing. Absolutely useless.
I realized I'm next to the hotel now. A bit decoration at the entrance but by looking to the
windows I see there is not much more. A string of lights around the sign. 'Hillerts Hotel'. That
reminded me of something. In the last math lesson we had Hilbert's Hotel with the infinite
amount of rooms and the infinite amount of guest in the infinite amount of rooms and the
second infinite amount of guest that want in the infinite amount of rooms too and the infinite
amount of busses with infinite amount of guests that want in the infinite amounts of... Stop
it! That's to much infinity! I have an other goal for today!
Not much later I arrive at the market. I walk though it and look at the stands and what they
sell. One have nutcrackers looks like really good quality and panted by hand. My mother
loves that fairy tale but there are so much people. I will buy something to eat and then I
come back. It is a while a had the nice waffles from a christmas market.
By walking back I look at the waffle. It is nearly a circle with spares in it. Would be interesting
how much I get for my money. The dough is in average maybe 2 mm thick. The diameter is
around 20 cm. The squares maybe 1 square cm and the walls on one side a half cm high.
Hmm...
By coming to the conclusion the incomplete squares at the edge are to hard to calculate now
I finish the waffle and leave the market with a bag and a present in it. On my further way I
notice a entrance gate. It looks like a parable opend downwards with a mistletoe hanging in
the maximum. A couple is kissing under it. 'Aww how sweet' would some people say but
please not in front of me.
I see a shop for computers and accessories. I decide to go in. Maybe the have some good
deals. Also my computer mouse was broken the last time gaming. Let's look what they have
on computer mice. I absolutely need a new one... of course for my studies. First I have to go
along the mouse pads. 'Fun Dad, Wise Dad, Kind Dad, Strong Dad, Faire Dad, Sweet Dad,
Best Dad, My Dad' That looks good. I think it would be a good present. Next to it I see an
other pad with the 'Hello World!' program written in C. I have to think off my sister. She saw
me one time by programming and didn't understand it. I could write a little program for her to
show what you can do by programming. Maybe a little interactive christmas story. I only have
to get the story the other part will be easy. Where could it play? Who is in it? What will
happen? Hmm...
By remembering I'm on my way to buy her real present I'm already in front of the correct
shop. I go in with the intent not to be distracted. Because I'm here I combined it with
purchasing. Some food some daily needed thing. Not much. By paying at the cash register I
feel lucky because my money was enough. A bit over 2€ and I have everything I need. Nice.
Now back home. I walk back focused on the way.
Finally home. The way back seems way shorter. Strange but isn't it so everytime? Let's hide
the presents and I'm done for today...
Crap! The purchase is here. I've bought a computer mouse. When? A cup? It's a nice one
sure whit snowflakes in a pattern and nice symmetrical but why? And where? At the market?
No present by it? Ahhh... Oh man... Damn!... Looks like... next try tomorrow...

## Story by Gideon Hoffmann

{{1}}
At Christmas, not that many years ago, a mathematician decided to solve a very complex Christmas
problem once and for all. The problem he faced was very serious: what he searched was nothing less
than the ultimate placement of the various presents under the Christmas tree. It shouldn’t be too
simple, but also not to complicated, a good mix. The characteristics he considered into his solution
were the size and the receiver of the presents. He wanted to split the big and small packages equally
and meanwhile place multiple presents for the same person closer together.
The mathematician was specialised in discrete mathematics and decided to approximate the
problem using the mathematical field of Graph Theory. He represented the presents as vertices of
the graphs in his model and divided the presents into certain sizes, which he represented using a
graph, which connected every present with said size. To achieve that, he placed edges (connections)
between the vertices (elements) of the group. This first graph was undirected, since the vertices
were connected symmetrically. The second graph represented the receivers of the presents and
grouped them in a similar way.
Finally, he tried to order the presents in a way that they were grouped in the second, but not in the
first graph. Therefore, he made the third graph, which was directed. He took a starting present and
connected it asymmetrically with a different present, which had a connection to the first one in the
second, but not in the first graph. If multiple of those presents were available, he chose the one
whose size group was the longest to not to be included. After the connection, the newly connected
present was chosen as the base for the next edge and new connections were only being made to
presents, which had no connection in the third graph yet. If only presents from the same size group
or a different ownership were available, the ownership got prioritised. Following that pattern, all
presents were connected and the last one was connected to the first one. The third graph formed an
imaginary ring, which only had to be laid around the Christmas tree.
With this simple algorithmical solution, the mathematician managed to solve this problem and could
finally sleep again.

## A Christmas story

{{1}}
On a snowy Christmas eve people normally would have fun and spent time with the family and loved ones.
This time however one family could not do the usual Christmas stuff. Because the two sons of the family had math homework. Nevertheless, it was no ordinary math homework. 
The youngest son despaired of his homework at the dining table. His father walked inside the room and questioned his son’s behaviour. The son then replies to him, “Equations no longer make sense. And my calculator doesn't give the correct answers for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Or since when is the sum of two natural numbers something negative?”
“I`m sure your calculator is broken. Let me take a look at it.”, his dad examine the calculator and he had no answer either to why the calculator did not work.
“I bet it's the Grinch's fault.”, but the son's answer did not convince the father. Shortly thereafter, the older son says that his homework doesn't make any sense either, “How can a statement be false and true at the same time?” Even after looking at his son’s homework the dad had no answer to his son’s question and was even more confused.
All was silent and everyone pondered the strange problem. 
In the silence the family heard a giggle and everyone's attention focused on the sound. The Grinch jumped out from his hiding spot behind the sofa and spoke in a shrill voice, “I’ve changed the logic of math, so nothing makes sense anymore. That's why you can't enjoy Christmas today.”
“I knew it!”, exclaimed the youngest son. The Father was in disbelief and did not know what to say.
Suddenly everyone heard a bang and they saw Santa Claus falling down the chimney. (Fortunately, the fireplace was out of order) 
“You will no longer disturb the Christmas spirit!”, Santa Claus pulled the Grinch out of the house by the ear. After a few minutes Santa Claus came back and told the family that everything should be normal again. The son grabbed his calculator and said, “The calculator seems to work again, for example, it outputs again three to the power of three equals 27.” The older son's homework made sense again, too. The father was still at a loss for words.
Santa Claus distributed the gifts to the family.  Finally, the family could enjoy the rest of the Christmas holidays without having to worry about incorrect maths.

"story": "It was Christmas Eve and Mary was working late at the workshop, trying to finish
up her latest invention. She was an engineer, and she loved nothing more than tinkering with
gadgets and machines. As she worked, she couldn't help but think about all the ways that
technology had changed over the years. She remembered the days when cars had clunky
engines and transmissions that were prone to breaking down. Now, with the help of
advanced computer systems and precision manufacturing, cars are smoother and more
reliable than ever. But Mary wasn't satisfied with just making things work better. She was
always looking for ways to refine her designs and make them even more efficient. And that's
why she was working on a new engine that would use a revolutionary fuel-injection system
to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. She had been working on the engine for
months, and she was finally getting close to finishing it. But there was still one crucial
problem to solve: the balance. The engine had to be perfectly balanced in order to run
smoothly, and Mary was struggling to get it just right. As she sat at her desk, staring at the
diagrams and calculations in front of her, she heard a knock at the door. It was her husband,
John, who had been working late at his own job. 'Come on, Mary,' he said, smiling. 'It's
Christmas Eve. You can finish this tomorrow. Let's go home and enjoy the holiday.' Mary
hesitated for a moment, but then she decided that John was right. She had been working
hard all year, and she deserved a break. She packed up her things and followed John out of
the workshop, feeling a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction as she closed the door
behind her. As they walked home through the snowy streets, Mary couldn't help but feel
grateful for all the technology that had helped her achieve her goals. And she knew that with
a little more hard work and a lot of holiday cheer, she would be able to refine her engine and
make it even better in the coming year."

## Christmas story of Spector

{{1}}
It was Christmas Eve and the air was filled with excitement and cheer. All the children
in town were preparing for Santa's arrival, while the adults were busy decorating their
houses and setting up the Christmas tree.
Meanwhile, in the workshop of Santa's toy factory, the elves were working hard to get
all the toys ready in time. The factory was filled with the sounds of machines whirring
and the clanging of tools.
One elf, named Spector, was working on a new toy robot that could sing and dance.
He had been coding and debugging the robot for weeks, pouring over lines of code
and carefully testing each function to make sure it worked perfectly.
Spector was a skilled coder, but even he had to admit that this project had been a bit
of a challenge. The robot was supposed to be able to recognize and respond to
different types of music, and that required a lot of complex algorithms and machine
learning techniques.
But despite the difficulties, Spector was determined to get the robot just right. He
spent long hours in the workshop, tweaking and adjusting the code, until finally he
was satisfied that it was ready for a test run.
But as he was putting the finishing touches on the robot, disaster struck. The
computer system crashed and all the code Spector had written was lost.
Spector was devastated. Without the code, the robot wouldn't be able to sing and
dance like it was supposed to. He didn't know how he was going to fix the problem in
time for Christmas.
Just then, his friend Holly walked in. "What's wrong, Spector?" she asked.
Spector explained the situation and Holly immediately sprang into action. She knew a
lot about computers and coding, and she was sure she could help Spector recover
the lost code.
Together, they spent the rest of the night debugging the computer and trying to
restore the code. It was a long and difficult process, with Spector and Holly pouring
over lines of code and trying different solutions to fix the problem.
But finally, just as the sun was rising on Christmas morning, they succeeded. The
robot was finally complete and Spector was able to give it a test run.
As the robot began to sing and dance, Spector couldn't help but feel a sense of pride
and accomplishment. The robot moved smoothly and gracefully, its metallic arms and
legs perfectly synchronized with the beat of the music. It twirled and spun, its sensors
detecting changes in the tempo and adjusting its movements accordingly.
Thanks to Holly's help, Spector was able to deliver the robot to Santa in time for
Christmas. And when the children opened their presents on Christmas morning, they
were thrilled to find the singing and dancing robot waiting for them.
As Spector watched the children play with the robot, he couldn't help but feel a sense
of pride and accomplishment. It had been a long and difficult journey, but in the end,
all the hard work had paid off.
Merry Christmas!

## Instructions of making a Christmas wreath

{{1}}
Dear diary,
today I want to share our Christmas tradition with you:
Instructions of making a Christmas wreath
It’s the time of the year again, all bright and light. Wintertime - the degrees near
zero, sometimes even enough to let it snow.
In an long or short interval everyone is decorating. Candles, chains of light,
nutcrackers and of course a Christmas tree full of baubles. I am for sure making
less than the common.
I restrict myself to make a unique wreath every year. For me the root of the hole
Christmas thing is to be pleased and thankful with what you are and what you
have.
Therefore I just making a wreath and maybe light up some candles.
The origin of this tradition given in my family, started with my grandma.
All you need is one component, a reliable local shop with all kind of decorations
for Christmas.
I like branches of a fir tree, wire, to tie the branches to a wreath, four candles,
cinnamon sticks and dried slices of oranges – I forgot to do it by myself this year.
At a relaxed evening I make a hot chocolate and tinker all pieces together. Some
hours later the whole flat smells like Christmas and a beautiful wreath is laying
on the table.
From now on I can say it’s Christmas time.
So merry Christmas and a happy new year!

## Ones Chrismas Story

{{1}}
We note a year after the invention of computers,
furthermore, today is the 24th of December and – most important! — Friday.

Our dear protagonist sits in a large and empty place, only illuminated by the blueish light of the monitor and a small desk lamp.
All around is a labyrinth of shoulder-high space separators.
It is already dark outside, the cities lights paint the sky in a dark orange.

This last commit and our protagonist will also leave for the holidays.
But as one can imagine, the work is as complicated as it always is when you are about to finish.
Finally, here it is, but wait! Oh, no!
Patches have to be live tomorrow, and testing won't happen today anymore.
Straight to production, it is then!

My dear audience, never, never ever, deploy to prod on Fridays!

A few minutes later, our protagonist is on the way home, suddenly, darkness.
Darkness everywhere around. No sound, too!

No streetlight, no billboard, no display
no window, no festive decoration
is shining anymore.

Well, if you work on a cities digitalized electricity infrastructure,
you should avoid such mistakes even more …

But now it is too late, no way to fix this without a working machine.
Manpower is needed to get the net back up.
It starts snowing.
For the first time this year, and so continues our pitiful protagonist on the way home.

Meanwhile, the people around in the houses have remembered the old candles still lying around in some forgotten corner.
Stearin for the rescue!

And there, a light! Now two, soon three!
Infrared rays fall on long forgotten memories of Christmas eves years ago.
There is new warmth here in the cold of winter.
Without the ongoing distraction by mobile handheld devices, “smart” and stupid IOT devices,
they become clear again, the important things in life.

While the outside around our protagonist turns into a winter wonderland, a bug induced miracle is going on.
The forced digital detox is doing its work.

The next morning, everything around is painted white by dihydrogenmonoxide crystals.
Soon the outtake's being fixed.

What about our protagonist?
Legends tell the following:
  - Our protagonist did spend the night with long not seen friends.
  - Our protagonist met the awakened queen of winter, both went off to a new journey.
  - Our protagonist woke up on December 24.
  - And much else.
Does it matter?
In the end, “protagonist” may not have been such a great implementation of a plot driving element.
However, I, the narrator, am not owing anything to you!

Moral of the story? Don't deploy to production on Fridays, unless it is Friday the 24th of December.

This is not meant to encourage willful sabotage of critical infrastructure!

Well then, merry Christmas everyone and a happy new year!

## Timmy’s last Christmas wish

{{1}}
Once, there was little Timmy. Timmy seemingly was an ordinary child, but deep inside he
had great ambitions. As everyone knows, Santa Claus has billions of cameras hidden all
around the world to know which children were good that year. Timmy needed to be a very
good child to have his wish granted, so instead of trying his best to be good that year, he
had other plans.
Timmy searched for all the cameras and hacked them, so that whenever he wanted to do
something naughty, the cameras would show a pre-recorded loop of him being good. At the
beginning of December, when he finally got the chance to list his wished, he assumed
everything had gone well and Santa would think he was a very good child.
Timmy wished for a sentient AI that would do his math homework for him. When Santa read
his wish, he laughed out loud. Santa of course knew that his perfect examination system
(aka total surveillance) had found out that it had been tempered with, so instead of gifting
him the AI, Santa simply brought Timmy a little indestructible drone that would follow him
for the entire next year.
Dear Santa, please stop spying on me, just assume I was good this year, thank you :)
