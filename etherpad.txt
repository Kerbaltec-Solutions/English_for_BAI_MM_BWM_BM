Do robots get more human and/or humans more robotic
probably both. Cyborgs and stuff.

Is it even possible to create conscious AI?
Definition conscious: characterized by or having an awareness of one's environment and one's own existence, sensations, and thoughts. synonym: aware.
As of right now not possible for us to build conscious machines

the best way to learn
learngroups
taking notes and let others explain how they approached this topic 
balance your study and life 
write a cheat sheet for the test, use it, get caught 🤣
hear–> see–>write down–>explain to someone else 
take breaks ' Like 0,5
procrastinating 

the best source to learn 
- own notes from lectures
- educational YouTube channels s
books for complex topics and videos for specific knowledge

Depends on What you learn: l
    For Math u need to Understand it first and then get lots of practice 

Understanding is important for learning almost any topic.

My partner and I deserve a cross each week, he was too early and didn't see any videos so he wasnt able to write a summary about one and whenever he checked all videos had already a summary and he didnt know we could make 2 for one video, he also actively improved his english with c and c++ tutorials in english and reading a few chapters in a book about computer networks (explanations of UDP and TCP). I didnt find a video which I deemed worthy of sharing I was only finding either very short videos like 3-4, or way to long with durations of above an hour and even more. Therefore I tried to improve my english more than 90 minutes, I watched the South African "Springboks" beat the "three lions" England 27-14, I watched two episodes of an english series, called "Blacklist", I was phoning a friend in Australia with whom I speak english since his german doesnt go further than "guten morgen" and I was talking a lot to my south african girlfriend.

My Partner wrote the longest essay I've ever seen. Well structured and interestingly written. So much effort.....


Me and my partner absolutely deserve a cross for the last two weeks as both have managed to create an absolutely stunning amount of work of exactly 0.
Last week my partner had quite long gaming session and me I have been reading at least 50 pages of manuals in technical english. We booth did not have the time to write a monologue such as green above did and is still doing but we are very proud of our work. Also, I'm getting pretty good at understanding songtexts in harsh vocals.

My Partner deserves a cross for both weeks, because she found a video on a computer scientist and wrote a summary on another computer scientist. She did a fantastic work. And she read abook in english for the last task.
My Partner deserves a cross in both weeks because of his amazing help in mathematics. For the last task he watched videos for alternative words for often used words. (example: very)


My partner and I deserve one cross each week, because on the one hand, he used an English book (Proofs: A long-form mathematics textbook by Jay Cummings) to study hard mathematical theorems. On the other hand I created the GitHub repo for this course and because I'm not that experienced in Git I had to watch English tutorials to find out how it works. So we not only improved our English skills, but also we got better with Github, LiaScript and math by sharing what we found out.

My partner and I deserves a cross, because we really take the tasks seriously. We both chose videos half hour long and wrote summarys that are high quality ones. The second task was to do something to improve our english skills so one of us decided to play a mobile multiplayer game to improve his everyday-english and the other continues to read the autobiography of Barack Obama "A promised land".
We realllllllly want these crosses!!!!

My partner deserves one cross each week: in the first week, they chose a video and wrote a pretty long/detailed summary, which appears to have taken even more than 90 minutes. Last week, they watched a 90 minute long documentary about the Third Crusade (https://youtu.be/jCyCSgsFXKQ, highly recommended), and analyzed its structure and how the information was presented in an interesting manner.

My partner deserves both of the crosses, since he complete both weeks tasks with more than necessary amounts of effort. In the first week, he contributed a video and wrote a long summary of another one. In the second week, he increased his communication skills by contributing online to an open-source-program and communicating the issues, abilities and performance of the code. He also watched an educational video about a specific mathematic problem in order to increase his scientific language skills.

My partner and I deserve a cross for both weeks. We wrote summarys about the mathematicans Russel and Laplace. In the second week my partner read the book the giver in English and i watched the movie days of future past in english.
