### Summary 1/2
{{1}}
Ada Lovelace was born Augusta Ada Byron in London on December 10, 1815. She was the daughter of the romantic poet Lord Byron and Annabella Milbanke, who was strictly religious and possessed a fascination for analytics and logic. Her father left his wife in 1916 and died 11 years later in the Greek War of Independence. Thanks to her mother’s influence, Ada received an education rigorous in mathematics and science. She showed promise for the two fields, in which she was also very gifted. At the age of 12 she conceptualized a flying machine that could flap its wings. Until the Age of 16, Ada Lovelace almost permanently battled sickness and was temporarily disabled.
In 1833, she attended a coveted party hosted by the famed inventor Charles Babbage, who would later be known as the father of the computer. She caught his eye because of her interest in one of his inventions and he remained her mentor and lifelong friend.
Ada Byron wed William Kind at the age of 19. Her Husband later became Earl of Lovelace and Ada took the title Countess of Lovelace. They had three Children together and a large household, but Ada managed to find much time for studying mathematics nevertheless. As an adult, Ada again struggled with illness, most notably cholera and asthma.
Her most important work was an article she published in Scientific Memoirs, an English scientific journal in 1843. The article was about the Analytical Engine, an invention of her mentor Charles Babbage which is considered to be the world’s first programmable general-purpose computer. It consisted of a calculator, a storage for data and an input and output device. In her article, Ada wrote of how the engine could be programmed with a code to calculate Bernoulli numbers. This was an algorithm to be carried out by a machine and thus the first computer program. Therefore, Ada Lovelace is considered to be the very first computer programmer – in an age long before modern computers existed. Ada also described how codes could be created for the device to handle numbers, letters and symbols. She theorized a method for looping of instructions, a process computer programs still use today. In her paper, Ada also offered up concepts about topics like artificial intelligence. With her article, Ada Lovelace reached a transition between mechanical and modern computing by seeing the full potential of Babbage’s Machine, which he never saw.
Ada Lovelace died of uterine cancer on November 27, 1852 at the age of 36. She was buried in the Byron family vault inside the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in the English town of Hucknall.
Ada’s contributions to modern computer science where basically discovered by Alan Turing in the 1940s. He was strongly influenced by Lovelace’s and Babbage’s works and later became known as the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. In the 1970s, the first standardized programming language was named “Ada” after Lovelace’s legacy. It is still used to this day in the operation of real-time systems in many fields.
All in All, Ada’s vision far surpassed any of her contemporaries and laid the very foundations of modern computer programming science.

In the YouTube video "Ada Lovelace: The First Computer Programmer" handles the author, Biographics in this case, the Biography of previously mentioned Ada Lovelace. 
"Biographics" starts off with Adas early childhood and mentions her mothers fanaticism to steer her in the exact opposite way of her father, who she saw as mentally ill because of his poetic mind. 
The chosen course was therefore mathematics, in which Ada was gifted, and science in general. Lessons in self-control were given to her by her mother in which she was to sit still or lie down, unmoving, over a big amount of time. 
Ada then battled sickness from the age of 14 to 17. After that she was presented at court and charmed them with her "brilliant mind"
At one such party she learned of the Difference Engine, a calculator invented by the "father of the computer". Her enthusiasm in face of the machine earned herself a mentor and lifelong friend in Charles Babbage.
After learning of the Analytical Engine from her mentor she dedicated little over a decade into studying it. Under this study falls the translation and commentation of a french article. 
Ada Lovelace exceeded her mentor in realizing the full potential of the machine. She didn't stop with numbers but theorized that with the help of codes the engine could even process letters. 
The following part of the video is about her personal life. She had a husband and three children after which she shifted her focus back to mathematics and science. Her health was, after a case of cholera, not as good as it used to be and she suffered under her medication with mood swings and hallucinations. 
Ada flirted and later even started to gamble on horses until she died of cancer in 1852. After that she was buried next to her father.
At last  "Biographics" talks about her legacy. 
An example for that are Alan Turing, who was greatly influenced by her notes, and the high-order computer programming language Ada. Until today it is still used in many areas such as health care, transportation and many more.
Furthermore there is an entire day in October named after her.

A (very) Brief History of Bertrand Russell

{{1}}
Bertrand Russel was a very influential mathematician and philosopher.
He was born as the youngest son of a British aristocrat family with very progressive views.
After his parents and sister died of illnesses, he and his brother Frank were raised by his grandmother, who was a devout christian, but otherwise very progressive.
Despite her insistence on raising him christian, Bertrand Russell became an atheist at 18.

{{1}}
Russell had suicidal thoughts in his youth, but his interest in learning gave him motivation to live. According to him, mathematics saved his life.

{{1}}
He studied mathematics at Cambridge.
{{1}}
    
He went to Italy and met other important mathematicians.

{{1}}
Ludwig Wittgenstein was a student of his.

{{1}}
During World War I, he was sent to prison for his pacifist views.

{{1}}
He was originally excited about communism, but a trip to soviet Russia in 1920 changed his mind, though none of his travel companions shared his skepticism.

{{1}}
He was married four times.

{{1}}
After World War II, he argued that it would be more moral for the USA to fight a war against the USSR as long as only they had nuclear weapons, rather than when both countries would have them,  because it would mean fewer casualties. 
After it was known that the USSR had nuclear bombs too, he advocated for nuclear disarmment instead.
    He also opposed the Vietnam war.

## Alan Turing
!?[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTmsSG8OW5M)
### Summary
{{1}}
    One of Britain's greatest mathematicians and a hero who saved millions of lifes with his scientific discoveries. We’re talking about Alan Turing who was born in London in 1912.

{{1}}
    In his early childhood he and his brother were in charge of a military man. This was a very agonizing part of his life and his father recognized that. As a consequence he sent Alan to the Sherborne School in Dorset in 1925. There he met Christopher Morcom, the first love of his life. In the following years they spent much time together discussing math and science. Alan's life was shattered into pieces when Christopher died of tuberculosis in 1930.
    
{{1}}
    Later in 1931 Turing left Sherborne and enrolled in the King's College in Cambridge and began studying math. There he earned his first degree and in 1936 he finished his masterpiece on Computable Numbers with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem. Part of his work was a thought experiment containing something called “Turing Machine”. With that he invented the basis for modern digital computers by proving how you could take the human process of computing numbers and create a machine capable of doing the same.

{{1}}
    In 1938 Turing began working in the British signals interception and code cracking branch. After the start of WWII in 1939 Turing was reassigned to Hut 8 at Bletchley Park and led a team tasked with decoding the German Enigma codes for naval transmission. The Enigma was a cipher machine invented by the Germans in WWI which only could be decoded by having a copy of the machine and the cipher key. In the summer of 1941 Turing and his team managed to develop a technique that broke the naval Enigma codes. This made it possible to locate German u-boats and to secure the supply of food to Britain and save the lives of millions. 

{{1}}
    After the war Turing got the Order of the British Empire, one of Britain's highest honors. In 1950 he created the famous “Turing Test” which determines if a machine has human-level intelligence. During the following years Turing spent time on creating artificial life as one of the first people. All in all he was a famous mathematician and hero in Great Britain at this time. 

{{1}}
    But all of that changed when he started a relationship with Arnold Murry. Both of them got arrested for gay activities in 1952. When Turing pled guilty to one count of gross indecency he had to choose between one year in prison or chemical castration. After his conviction he wasn’t considered a hero anymore, but much more as a monster by the public. Also he lost the support of his family completely.

{{1}}
    On a rainy morning in 1954 his housekeeper found him dead laying in his bed with a half eaten apple beside him. He poisoned the apple with cyanide and committed suicide. 13 years after his dead, homosexuality got decriminalized in Great Britain and in 2009 Prime Minister Gordon Brown made a formal apology to him.

{{1}}
    To this day, Alan Turing's work in computing, artificial intelligence and other fields is considered to have been pioneering. But also during WWII he had a massive impact on the world by saving millions of lives and by shortening the war by roughly two years. Sadly he was driven to committing suicide because of the discrimination of gay people.

## Pierre-Simon Laplace
!?[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg7rNrCXXfQ)
### Summary 1/2
{{1}}
Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace was a French mathematician, physicist and astronomer born March 23, 1749 in Normandy, France. As the son of wealthy parents, he attended a benedictine priory school and at the age of 16, he further pursued his father’s wishes by studying theology at the University of Caen. There, he discovered his interest and abilities in mathematics. Laplace was given a recommendation letter to Jean d’Alembert – a respected mathematician at the time – by one of his mentors, which allowed him to leave the University of Caen and go to Paris. There, he managed to impress d’Alembert with his abilities, which secured Laplace a lecture position at the “École Militaire”. Not only did this give him a stable source of income and time for research, but he also met powerful people or people who were soon to be in power, such as Napoleon Bonaparte – one of his students.
His work in the field of physics includes the dynamic theory of tides that explains how oceans react to tides – more accurately than Isaac Newton's theory, which ignored the rotation of the earth.
Laplace later found out that there must be gravitational forces between the planets in the solar system, explaining the observed deviations of planets from their theoretical orbits and approaching the idea of evolutionary change. Antoine Lavoisier, the “father of modern chemistry”, collaborated with Laplace and published various papers on matters like the kinetic theory of molecular motion. Laplace later published his ideas about “scalar potential”, further developing the potential function – today known as “Laplace’s equation” and used in many fields like fluid dynamics and magnetism. Expanding the work of Euler, he also developed the “Laplace transform”, which is now fundamental in e.g. electrical engineering. In his “analytic theory of probabilities”, Laplace demonstrated the usefulness of probability for interpreting scientific data and published his findings including the DeMoivre-Laplace Limit Theorem, Bayes Rule, and more. As a part of the standardization committee, he was one of the people who worked on the metric system.
At age 39, Laplace married Marie-Charlotte de Courty de Romanges, an 18-year-old girl from a wealthy family, who he had a son and a daughter with. He and his family moved out of Paris during the Reign of Terror, during which a lot of people – including other scientists – were executed.
In 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte came to power in France using a coup, and appointed Laplace to be the minister of interior. It is however likely that he was only meant to be a placeholder until Napoleon gained full power, after which Laplace was replaced with Napoleon’s brother. Laplace’s involvement in politics made him lose many relationships, but he got fairly close to Napoleon. In the 1810s, the strong relationship between Napoleon and Laplace quickly descended after Laplace lost respect for Napoleon as a leader, and especially after Napoleon was enormously insensitive about Laplace’s daughter dying while giving birth to his granddaughter in 1813 – stating that this event should be irrelevant to Laplace because he is a mathematician. From this point on, he heavily supported the return of the Bourbon Dynasty and their Restoration, which directly opposed Napoleon.
On March 5, 1827, Laplace died in Paris, likely due to natural causes, and was buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

{{1}}
The Video ,,A (very) Brief History of Pierre-Simon Laplace” is about the mathematician LaPlace. 
A few examples for his more famous works are Bayesian interpretation of probability, The dynamic theory of tides, The LaPlace transform and Mechanic celeste.
He was born on March 23rd 1749, in Normandy. His Family was involved in agriculture until 1750. He studied theology at the university of Caen, until he gained interest in mathematics. A mentor of his recommended Laplace to a lecture position at  École militaire. From 1770 to 1771 he presented works, like on the extreme of curves, difference equations, integral calculus, research on the calculus of infinitely small differences and finite difference.
LaPlace was very invested in mathematical physics too. (stability on the solar system, scalar potential)
In 1785 he published the Laplace transform, which is an integral transform method that can substantially ease finding the solution to a linear ordinary differential equation. LaPlace was made a member of the committee which was the standardized weights and measures working on the metric system and advocating for a decimal base in 1790. Six years later he published exposition du systeme du monde which provides a survey of the solar system giving general information about phenomena without detail and the nebular hypothesis. 1799 Napoleon came to power in France, he appointed LaPlace temporarily to be the minister of the interior, however Laplace was just the placeholder for Napoleon's brother.
He was involved in politics, and had a strong bond with Napoleon that lasted until the 1810s. Their companionship died, because Napoleon was insensitive towards Laplace around the time LaPlace´s daughter died. On March 5th 1827 Laplace died in Paris.

## Leonhard Euler 
!?[](https://youtu.be/kEYUDWf_UpQ)

### Summary 
{{1}}
Leonhard Euler was a Swiss mathematician born in Basel on April 15th 1707. The son of Paul Euler and Margaretha Brucker attended a school that didn’t include mathematical education. Therefore, he received it from his father and private lessons, as well as from studying mathematical textbooks on his own. His father, who wished for Leonhard to pursue the career of a minister (pastor), sent him to Basel University in 1720, Leonhard being only 13 years old. He got a general education there first and focused on more advanced  studies later. At Basel University, he met Johann Bernoulli, whose family Paul Bernoulli was friends with, and worked with him. In 1723, Leonhard finished his masters in philosophy,  but was discontent with it. Following that, he convinced his father that he would pursue mathematical studies. Leonhard finished university in 1726.
{{1}}
Euler got an offer from the St. Petersburg Academy, which he was recommended for by Daniel Bernoulli. After accepting the offer, he traveled there in 1727 and expected to start in a junior position, but was promoted to the department of mathematics. once again through recommendation. Until 1930, Euler was a lieutenant in the Russian navy alongside his teaching and research. He was finally able to leave after being promoted to professor of physics. In 1733, he was assigned a senior chair at the academy. Following that, he married Katharina Gsell, whom he had 13 children with, 5 of which survived infancy. By 1736 Euler had already published many articles and a textbook called “Mechanica”.
{{1}}
By 1740, Euler had been a renowned mathematician, so he eventually got an offer for a position at the University of Berlin by Frederik the Great himself, which he accepted. After traveling to Berlin in 1741, he stayed there for 25 years. During this time, Euler wrote his most renowned two works, the first being the  “introduction to infinitesimal analysis” (tl. from Latin), which was the foundation for mathematical analysis and also described the notation for functions that we use today.The second one was the “institutions of differential calculus”, the first complete and accurate text on the matter. In 1744, Euler was promoted to director of mathematics, giving him more responsibilities. Additionally, he became an advisor to the Prussian government, which negatively impacted his relationship with Frederik the Great.
{{1}}
In 1766, Euler got another offer from the St. Petersburg Academy, which he once again accepted. In his later life, Euler faced lots of struggles, one being his continuous loss of vision, eventually leading to blindness. Additionally, his house burnt down in 1771, destroying almost all of his properties. Another tragedy struck in 1773, when his wife of almost 40 years died. Nevertheless, Euler was more active than ever before during that period of time, publishing over half of his works in St. Petersburg with the help of his family and colleagues. EUler died in 1783 due to a brain hemorrhage, but his body of research was so vast that the St. Petersburg Academy kept publishing his studies until 50 years after his death. Some of Euler's most important contributions are Euler's identity, the gamma-function, the zeta-function and the solution to the Basler problem.

By 1736 Euler had already published many articles and a textbook called “Mechanica”.
By 1740, Euler had been a renowned mathematician, so he eventually got an offer for a position at the University of Berlin by Frederik the Great himself, which he accepted. After traveling to Berlin in 1741, he stayed there for 25 years. During this time, Euler wrote his most renowned two works, the first being the  “introduction to infinitesimal analysis” (tl. from Latin), which was the foundation for mathematical analysis and also described the notation for functions that we use today.The second one was the “institutions of differential calculus”, the first complete and accurate text on the matter. In 1744, Euler was promoted to director of mathematics, giving him more responsibilities. Additionally, he became an advisor to the Prussian government, which negatively impacted his relationship with Frederik the Great.
In 1766, Euler got another offer from the St. Petersburg Academy, which he once again accepted. In his later life, Euler faced lots of struggles, one being his continuous loss of vision, eventually leading to blindness. Additionally, his house burnt down in 1771, destroying almost all of his properties. Another tragedy struck in 1773, when his wife of almost 40 years died. Nevertheless, Euler was more active than ever before during that period of time, publishing over half of his works in St. Petersburg with the help of his family and colleagues. EUler died in 1783 due to a brain hemorrhage, but his body of research was so vast that the St. Petersburg Academy kept publishing his studies until 50 years after his death. Some of Euler's most important contributions are Euler's identity, the gamma-function, the zeta-function and the solution to the Basler problem.

### Summary

    Claude Shannon – „The Father of the Information Age“
    
{{1}}
    Claude Shannon invented 1948 the Information Theory – it says that every data can be represented, sent and stored in binary numbers, which means he invented digitalization. This is the basis of all digital communication that we are used to today.
    He also contributed to the development of integrated circuits, computers, cryptography, artificial intelligence and even genomics.

{{1}}
    His life started 1916 and he grew up in the small town Gaylord, Michigan. His father was a probate judge and his mother was the principal at the local highschool. He is a distant relative of Thomas Edinson and studied mathematics and electrical engineering at college in Ann Arbor. After graduating 1936 he went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
    Invention of the „logic machine“
    1938 (at the age of 22) he wrote his master thesis about Boolean algebra – envisioning the on and off position of switching circuits as the basis of a „logic machine“ – by this he created the field of digital logic and outlines that it's possible to build electronic circuits with the boolean connectors „and“, „or“ and „not“.
    In 1940 he left MIT to teach a year at Princeton. During one of his lectures Albert Einstein walked in, asking where tea was being served.
    Encryption work
    After this Shannon worked in Bell Telephone Laboratories on anti-aircraft devices and as a cryptographer. Some of his encryption work was built in the complex scrambling machine used by Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill (during world war) – later he spelled out the fundamentals of modern cryptography in a paper called „Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems“
    Digital communication
    When world war ended, Shannon focused on how to apply binary values to telephone switching circuits to communicate over a long way without disturbing noises (imperfections) from amplifying analog signals – and founds this new (digital) way information can be transmitted.
    In 1948 he published the paper „A Mathematical Theory of Communication“, in which the word „bit“ for „binary digit“ appears firstly (it is attributed to a fellow researcher of Bell labs, John W. Tukey).
    This paper later get called the „Magna Carta of the Information Age“
    Based on this paper he built with his employees the regenerative repeater to replace the amplifier used for transmitting analog signals.
    In 1949 he married Mary Elizabeth Moore (numerical analyst at Bell labs).
    He also thought about the limit of the data rate while transmitting information  – today known as the Shannon limit or Shannon capacity.
    During the 1950s he invented many more theories on storage and transmission of digital information like compression or rebuilding bits lost by corruption.
    Later life
    At his house he built chess computers and created algorithms that are used still today.
    In 1956 he left Bell labs to teach at MIT. When he was at home, he constructed many mechanical devices inside his house.
    Also he devises the portfolio theory for the stock exchange market.
    A huge union called the Information Theory Society (today IEEE – Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) is based on his paper from 1948.
    After a long teaching career at MIT, he retired in 1978.
    In honor of his lifework, for example he won the first Kyoto prize, a statue of him was set up 2000 in his hometown Gaylord and the Bell laboratories buildings were rechristened after him and his wife.
    On the 24th february 2001 he lost at the age of 84 his long battle against Alzheimer's disease.

He lived in the 9.th century. That was the "golden age of science". He wrote the book of algebra that's a basic of today's calculation. With algorithms he also makes the calculation easier for the people of that time.
The biggest time of his life he lived in Bagdad and was working there in the house of wisdom. It's a place where the knowledge where collected and scholars and scientists of all religions could work in their areas.
He was part of the creating of the decimal system. 
There are also some examples of the use of his work today like aerobatic, the building of an supersonic car or an calculation in the Roman system and the decimal system.
