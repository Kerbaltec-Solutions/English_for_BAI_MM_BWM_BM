# Hilbert's Hotel

> Hilbert's Hotel is a thought experiment by David Hilbert, exploring the nature of infinity.  

There is an hotel with an unlimited number of rooms. However, it is fully booked.

One guest arrives at the hotel.
===
Even though the hotel is fully booked, the new guest is still able to get a room: since there are infinite rooms, the receptionist asks every existing guest to move to the room with their current room number plus one. That way, the first room will be free - and the new guest can move in.

A bus filled with an infinite amount of guests arrives at the hotel.
===
The receptionist asks every existing guest to go to the room with the number equal to the double of their current room number. That way, every room with an even number has a guest in it, and every room with an odd number is free. This creates an infinite amount of rooms, which means that everyone in the bus can move into the room with the number equal to double their seat number plus one.

An infinite number of busses - each with an infinite amount of guests - arrives at the hotel.
===
If all guests move in the depicted order and every guest who is last in the queue stops as soon as they enter a room, all guests will be spread across the rooms of the hotel.

The order in which the guests move is equal to what Georg Cantor used in his diagonalization proof which - among other things - showed that the set of natural numbers has the same cardinality as the set of rational numbers.
